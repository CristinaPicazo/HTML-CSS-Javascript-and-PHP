        <p  id="tribute-info">The garden is divided into four different sections, each with its own horticultural personality. 
            It also boasts two unique pieces of sculpture inspired by the Borough's maritime history. 
            The Ward family designed Bangor Castle Walled Garden in the 1840s. It was previously closed to the public and was 
            considered by many as a secret garden! North Down Borough Council restored this beautiful Garden and it was officially
            opened as a visitor attraction in April 2009. The garden won the Royal Horticultural Society Award for Permanent
            Landscaping in its first year of opening.</p>
