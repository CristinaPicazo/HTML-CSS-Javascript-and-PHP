# Cristina Picazo Merlos Portafolio

## General info
Personal Portafolio Cristina Picazo Merlos.

### I have created this repository when I heard through a podcast that it was important to work constantly in github to show what you are learning but in that time I had no clue how to use it so, as you can see here, I had created a monster adding everypage in the same repository.
### I will change it little by little to separate everythin in different repositories, as it should be, but until then I leave which technologies I used and what I have learned
